# Bug Fix: Order Matching Issue

## Problem
Users reported that when they input an Order ID like "ORD001" in the QR code input field, the system shows "未找到匹配的订单!" (Order not found!) even though the order is clearly visible in the grid.

## Root Cause
The `PlantingSlot.MatchesQRCode()` method was only matching against the `QRCode` field but not the `OrderId` field. Users naturally expect to be able to search by the Order ID since it's prominently displayed in the grid.

## Solution
Modified the `MatchesQRCode()` method in `PlantingSlot.cs` to match against both:
- QRCode field (original behavior)  
- OrderId field (new behavior)

Both matches are case-insensitive.

## Code Changes
**File**: `PlantingWallDemo/PlantingSlot.cs`
**Line**: 67-69

**Before**:
```csharp
return _orderData != null && _orderData.QRCode.Equals(qrCode, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

**After**:
```csharp
return _orderData != null && 
       (_orderData.QRCode.Equals(qrCode, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
        _orderData.OrderId.Equals(qrCode, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
```

## Impact
- ✅ Users can now search by Order ID (e.g., "ORD001")
- ✅ Users can still search by QR Code (e.g., "QR001")  
- ✅ Both searches are case-insensitive
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Minimal code change with maximum user benefit

## Test Cases Covered
1. Match by QRCode: "QR001" → ✅
2. Match by OrderId: "ORD001" → ✅ 
3. Case insensitive OrderId: "ord001" → ✅
4. Case insensitive QRCode: "qr001" → ✅
5. Invalid input rejection: "WRONG" → ✅
